<h3 > Statements I will take to the grave:</b> </h2>

- I can. I will. I must.
- Sometimes It's better to find out instead of wondering for life.
- Your are who you say you are by your actions.
- You chase something that you believe you deserve until you get it.
- If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
- Do not overthink your actions, it may cease you from accomplishing things outside of your comfort zone.
- sometimes you need to feel the pain and sting of defeat to activate the real passion and purpose that god predestined inside of you.
- purpose is an essential element of you, it is the reason you are on the planet at this particular time in history.
- whatever you choose for a career path, remember the struggles along the way are only meant to shape you for your purpose.
- How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!
- No one notices your tears, no one notices your sadness, no one notices your pain. But they all notice your mistakes.
