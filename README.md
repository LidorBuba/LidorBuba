## About me


Cowabunga, and welcome to my coding dojo of shenanigans and code-fu! I approach game development with the same passion as Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel, and with the skills of a coding wizard and ninja combined. From solo coding projects to collaborating with fellow developers, I'm always on a quest to create games that are both fun and geeky cool. Whether I'm slaying bugs or conjuring up digital mayhem, my obsession with computer science keeps me hacking my way to the top. Join me on this wild ride of coding and let's create some epic games that will blow your socks off (and maybe your computer too, who knows?).
